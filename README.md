# Adding
Calculate the sum of 1/n^2 from 1 until it each extra term is not too large

SUM = 1/1^2 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + 1/4^2 + 1/5^2 + etc etc etc
SUM = 1 + 0.25 + 0.111 + 0.0625 + 0.04 + etc etc etc

Do not need to add ALL terms FOREVER you should only continue WHILE the terms are not too small. For example, maybe you stop
add when the terms are less than 0.0000000000001
